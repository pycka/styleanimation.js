StyleAnimation

	-- Xbrowser CSS transitions --

									by Rados≈Çaw Pycka


jQuery-inspired, library-less JavaScript function for DOM animation. Works in a similar way to jQuery's animate() or CSS 3 transitions - transits (is it a proper word?) current css property state to that defined by property map. 

As of now, it only handles numeric properties (e.g. height, width) in different measurment units (px, pt, %). Other types, like color, will be added later (or you may do it by yourself - it's quite easily expendable). Doesn't require any additional libraries and works in all modern browsers, and by modern I mean IE 6+.

And the best part, filesize:
- development version: 	~ 8kB
- production (minified) ~ 2.5kB (!)
- gzipped				~ 1kB (!!) 


Status: usable / under active development


TODO:
- docs
- demos
- (moz|webkit)RequestAnimationFrame - already ready, just code it
- examples
- accessors for color, opacity and other transitions
- speed optimization
- testing
