StyleAnimation

	-- Xbrowser CSS transitions --

									by Rados≈Çaw Pycka


Small, jQuery-inspired, dependency-free JavaScript utility for DOM animation. Works in a similar way to jQuery's animate() or CSS 3 transitions - transits current css state to that defined by property map. 

As of now, it only handles numeric properties (e.g. height, width) in different measurment units (px, pt, %). Other types, like color, will be added later (or you may do it by yourself - it's quite easily expendable).

Doesn't require any additional libraries or frameworks and supports all modern browsers, and by modern I mean IE 6+.

Status: usable / under active development


TODO:
- docs
- demos
- examples
- accessors for color, opacity and other transitions
- speed optimization
- testing
